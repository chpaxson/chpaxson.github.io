                        <a href="http://e4e.ucsd.edu/fishsense">Fishsense</a> is a UCSD research project that utilizes depth cameras and AI to catalogue fish populations.  My job was to design the waterproof enclosure for its batteries, data storage, and AI processor.

                        Of course, this was my first <i>serious</i> project, so I made quite a few mistakes along the way.  I think I've learned from them, and I hope I can work better and faster with future projects.

                        This is a 15:1 cycloidal drive reducer.  I hope to use it to reduce BLDC motors for a 6-axis arm project, similar to <a href="
                        https://hackaday.io/project/168259-atlas-6dof-3d-printed-universal-robot">Damian Lickindorf's Atlas robot</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reducer has a hollow shaft, so it will be possible to run cables through it.  The design is somewhat based off of <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/168498-opencyre">Damian's OpenCyRe</a> and used guidance from <a href="https://blogs.solidworks.com/teacher/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/Building-a-Cycloidal-Drive-with-SOLIDWORKS.pdf">this blog post</a>.

                        Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it to work dynamically in SOLIDWORKS.  The cycloidal discs were made with equation-driven curves, which to get to form a full loop, had to be split in half.  This meant I could not use a cam-follower mate in the assembly.

                        This project was quite fun, and I can see that I still have a long way to go in designing complex mechanical assemblies.
