## Experience\r
\r
### R&D Engineering Intern\r
**Hologic, Inc.** | *May 2023 - Aug 2025*\r
- Identified and resolved a reliability issue in a new workflow for a sample-preparation instrument using data-driven testing.\r
- Co-developed a hardware solution to address reliability issues in deployed Novodiag instruments.\r
- Boosted manufacturing throughput and reliability by refining a key step for a consumable cartridge, and designing a custom automated fixture.\r
- Independently designed and prototyped an automated reagent-preparation system for the Panther molecular diagnostics platform to demonstrate feasibility.\r
- Completed three consecutive summer internships, continuing part-time remote work during academic terms.\r
\r
### Student Researcher\r
**Biomimetic Millisystems Laboratory** | *Jan 2023 - Dec 2025*\r
- Designed components of a 7-axis non-ferromagnetic robot arm for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments inside an MRI scanner.\r
- Contributed to development and testing of a compact series-elastic actuator (SEA) with an integrated planetary or cycloidal gearbox, enabling active compliance in a non-backdrivable ultrasonic motor ([arXiv:2406.07670](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.07670)).\r
- Assisted in fabrication and assembly of a full 7-axis arm prototype.\r
- Designed a 3-axis parallel robot arm to test the feasibility of closed-loop MRI-based position control using a miniature marker coil ([archive.ismrm.org/2025/3310.html](https://archive.ismrm.org/2025/3310.html)).\r
- Redesigning and fabricating an improved elbow joint module with enhanced strength and reduced backlash.\r
- Designed a 3D-printed low-cost cable-actuated micromanipulator for Berkeley's SWARM Lab.\r
\r
### HOPE DeCal Instructor\r
**UC Berkeley** | *Aug 2024 - Dec 2025*\r
- Delivering lectures and helping revise curriculum for UC Berkeley's Hands-On PCB Engineering (HOPE) student-run DeCal course.\r
- Mentoring student teams through schematic design, layout, fabrication, assembly, and bring-up of production-ready PCBs.\r
\r
### Mechanical Engineer\r
**Triton Robosub** | *Aug 2020 - Jul 2022*\r
- Designed a new waterproof camera module for the FishSense project to contain a depth camera and processor to assist in cataloguing fish with AI.\r
  - Updated the initial prototype described here: [ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9705929](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9705929)\r
- Led the design update, modeling, sourcing components, and fabricating the new prototype for field testing and preliminary research.  \r
\r
### Teacher's Assistant\r
**Art of Problem Solving** | *Jul 2021 - Jul 2022*\r
- Helped teach 3rd grade and 7-9th grade students in summer math classes.\r
- Worked one-on-one with students in tutoring sessions.\r
\r
### FIRST Tech Challenge Participant\r
**Cherry Pi Robotics** | *Sep 2016 - Feb 2019*\r
- Starting in 6th grade, designed and built mechanical systems for a competition robot as part of a private middle school team\r
- Led the design and fabrication of our robot every year, including CAD modeling, prototyping, and machining\r
- Tested and iteratively tuned autonomous software for speed and reliability\r
- Qualified for the 2018 World Championships in Houston, TX.\r
- Mentored younger team members in design and fabrication techniques.\r
- Gained experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and time management.\r
