                There was a prototype of the system before I came on to the project that utilized a Raspberry Pi as the processor.
                It had issues with buoyancy, because the enclosure was mostly empty. My design switched it over to a NVIDIA Jetson
                TX-2 with a custom power board.
            </p>

                My design improved a lot of major aspects, but I also made a lot of small mistakes throughout the design process,
                and unfortunately, a few with the final design. There are a few bolts that were too long, and we came up with a few
                more features to implement. Some would be done on a new version of the module, and some can be applied to the
                current ones. Also, since I designed the assembly from the bottom up, with in-place relations and many, many
                external references, it is difficult to modify certain parts. I'm working on making all mechanical interfaces
                defined by sketch blocks.
