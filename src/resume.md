## Experience

### R&D Engineering Intern
**Hologic, Inc.** | *May 2023 - Aug 2025*
- Identified and resolved a reliability issue in a new workflow for a sample-preparation instrument using data-driven testing.
- Co-developed a hardware solution to address reliability issues in deployed Novodiag instruments.
- Improved throughput and reliability by refining a key manufacturing step for a consumable cartridge and designing an automated fixture.
- Independently designed and prototyped an automated reagent-preparation system for the Panther molecular diagnostics platform.
- Completed three consecutive summer internships, continuing part-time remote work during academic terms.

### Student Researcher
**Biomimetic Millisystems Laboratory** | *Jan 2023 - Dec 2025*
- Designed components of a 7-axis non-ferromagnetic robot arm for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments inside an MRI scanner.
- Supported the development of a compact series-elastic actuator (SEA) with an integrated planetary or cycloidal gearbox, enabling active compliance in a non-backdrivable ultrasonic motor ([arXiv:2406.07670](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.07670)).
- Assisted in fabrication and assembly of a a full 7-axis arm prototype.
- Designed a 3-axis parallel robot arm to test the feasibility of closed-loop MRI-based position control using a miniature marker coil ([archive.ismrm.org/2025/3310.html](https://archive.ismrm.org/2025/3310.html)).
- Redesigned and fabricated an improved elbow joint module with enhanced strength and reduced backlash.
- Designed a 3D-printed low-cost cable-actuated micromanipulator for Berkeley's SWARM Lab.

### HOPE DeCal Instructor
**UC Berkeley** | *Aug 2024 - Dec 2025*
- Lectured and helped revise curriculum for UC Berkeley's Hands-On PCB Engineering (HOPE) student-run DeCal course.
- Mentored student teams through schematic design, layout, fabrication, assembly, and bring-up of production-ready PCBs.

### Mechanical Engineer
**Triton Robosub** | *Aug 2020 - Jul 2022*
- Designed a waterproof camera module for the Fishsense project to contain a depth camera and processor to assist in cataloguing fish with AI .
  - Updated the initial prototype described here: ([ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9705929](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9705929))
- Sourced components, developed a bill of materials, and assembled prototypes for field testing and preliminary research.

### Teacher's Assistant
**Art of Problem Solving** | *Jul 2021 - Jul 2022*
- Helped teach 3rd grade and 7-9th grade students in summer math classes.
- Worked one-on-one with students in tutoring sessions.
