# Lyra

A largely 3D-printed 6-axis robot arm with a 1-meter reach and large payload.

## Overview

I built this for my ME102B class at Berkeley in Spring 2024, with Angel Garnica, David Gonzalez, and Daniel Morales.

This project demonstrates advanced robotic arm design with 3D-printed components. Lyra combines mechanical engineering, electronics, and software to create a capable and affordable robotic platform.
